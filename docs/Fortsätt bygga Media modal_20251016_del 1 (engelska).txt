TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION - MEDIA MODAL LAYOUT ISSUE
Date: 2025-10-16 Author: GitHub Copilot Status: Analysis Complete / Solution Proposed / Implementation Pending

1. ISSUE SUMMARY
The application's media modal component (MediaModal.tsx) suffers from critical layout issues when displaying images and videos. Specifically:

Images/videos expand beyond their container, pushing navigation controls and metadata off-screen
The modal lacks a consistent, fixed size, causing layout instability
Navigation controls (arrow buttons) are improperly positioned and styled
Media content lacks proper size constraints
The issue is purely CSS-related with all functional logic working correctly. It appears the modal was built with a mix of absolute positioning and flexbox layout techniques that conflict with each other.

2. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
After thorough examination of the components/MediaModal.tsx file, I identified the following specific issues:

Conflicting Layout Systems: The component mixes absolute positioning with flexbox in ways that create unpredictable layout behavior:

jsx
.media-modal-body {
  padding-top: 80px; /* Höjden på headern */
  padding-bottom: 250px; /* Höjden på botten-sektionen */
  position: absolute;
  top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}
No Size Constraints on Media: The media container grows to accommodate the image/video size rather than constraining the media to fit the container:

jsx
.media-modal-media {
  max-width: 100%;
  max-height: 100%;
  object-fit: contain;
  border-radius: 4px;
}
Fixed Height Bottom Section: The bottom section has a fixed height regardless of its content:

jsx
.bottom-section {
  position: absolute;
  bottom: 0;
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  height: 250px; /* Fast höjd för botten */
  ...
}
Erratic Caching Behavior: There appears to be aggressive caching at multiple levels (browser, Vercel) that makes CSS updates inconsistent. Changes to the existing component often don't appear even after hard refreshes.

3. PROPOSED SOLUTION
I propose a complete rewrite of the modal component with a clean, predictable layout structure using a new name to avoid caching issues. The solution was provided as DamageModal.tsx with these key improvements:

Fixed, Predictable Modal Size:

CSS
.dm-container {
  width: 550px;
  height: 600px;
  max-width: 90vw;
  max-height: 90vh;
}
Strict Media Container with Fixed Height:

CSS
.dm-media-wrapper {
  height: 300px;
  overflow: hidden;
}

.dm-media {
  max-width: 100%;
  max-height: 100%;
  object-fit: contain;
}
CSS Prefix Strategy: Using a new prefix (dm- instead of media-modal-) to ensure no CSS rules are accidentally inherited:

CSS
.dm-overlay { ... }
.dm-container { ... }
.dm-navigation { ... }
Clean Flexbox Layout:

CSS
.dm-body {
  flex: 1;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  overflow: hidden;
}
Proper Scrolling Control:

CSS
.dm-metadata {
  flex: 1;
  padding: 16px;
  overflow-y: auto; /* Only metadata scrolls if needed */
}
4. IMPLEMENTATION STEPS
For any developer implementing this solution:

Create the new components/DamageModal.tsx component with the provided code

Update app/rapport/page.tsx to import and use DamageModal instead of MediaModal:

jsx
import DamageModal from "@/components/DamageModal";

// At the bottom of the render function:
<DamageModal 
  open={modalOpen} 
  onClose={() => setModalOpen(false)} 
  media={modalMedia} 
  title={modalTitle} 
  currentIdx={modalIdx}
  isLoading={modalIsLoading}
  onPrev={modalMedia.length > 1 ? handleModalPrev : undefined} 
  onNext={modalMedia.length > 1 ? handleModalNext : undefined}
  hasPrev={modalIdx > 0} 
  hasNext={modalIdx < modalMedia.length - 1} 
/>
Deploy with cache clearing:

In Vercel, find the latest deployment
Click the three dots (...)
Select "Redeploy"
Uncheck "Use existing build cache"
Click "Redeploy"
The original MediaModal.tsx can be kept initially to ensure no other parts of the application are using it, but could be removed after confirming the new component works properly.

5. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE INSIGHTS
During the analysis, I gathered several insights about the application architecture that will be valuable for future development:

Data Flow for Damage Media:

The application uses a damages table for primary damage records
Associated media is stored in a damage_media table with a foreign key relationship
When a user clicks on a thumbnail in the report table, the system fetches all associated media from damage_media for that specific damage_id
Modal Implementation Pattern:

The app uses React's JSX with styled-jsx for component-scoped styling
Event handlers for keyboard navigation (Escape, arrow keys) are properly implemented
The modal has both a standard view and a fullscreen lightbox mode for images
Cache Management Issues:

The application appears to have aggressive caching at multiple levels
For future CSS changes, consider using unique class names or CSS modules
When making significant UI changes, performing a cache-cleared rebuild is essential
6. ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Beyond fixing the immediate modal layout issue, I recommend:

Component Structure Improvements:

Consider breaking down the modal into smaller sub-components (Header, MediaViewer, Navigation, Metadata)
This would improve maintainability and make future changes less risky
Responsive Design Enhancement:

The current modal design works but could be improved for very small screens
Consider adding specific breakpoints for mobile devices
Image Loading Optimization:

Add proper loading states for images (loading indicators, fallbacks)
Consider implementing lazy loading for gallery view
Testing Strategy:

Add visual regression tests for the modal to prevent future layout regressions
Test with various media types and sizes to ensure consistent display
7. KNOWN LIMITATIONS
The proposed solution has been thoroughly analyzed but has these known limitations:

It doesn't yet implement the gallery view functionality (when clicking on registration numbers)
The thumbnail images in the report table still need better size normalization
There's no zoom functionality for images in lightbox mode
8. CONCLUSION
The MediaModal layout issues stem from conflicting CSS approaches and lack of proper size constraints. The proposed solution provides a clean, predictable layout system using modern CSS best practices. The implementation uses a new component name to avoid cache-related issues, while maintaining all existing functionality.

When implementing this solution, be sure to deploy with cache clearing enabled to ensure a clean start.
